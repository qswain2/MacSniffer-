MacSniffer

MacSniffer is a GUI tool designed to "sniff" wireless networks by capturing 802.11X wireless packets as they are transmitted. The sniffer filters out non-management packets and process packets based on their subtype. The packets are processed and if present the SSID string and the BSSID, the address of the MAC address of the access point associated with a particular WLAN. After scanning the networks in range the application attempts to identify the vendor of the network card. If the hardware cannot be fingerprinted the application is capable of associating with a network if it is selected from the table view displaying the SSIDs and the BSSIDs by clicking the join button. If the network requires no authentication both fields in the modal window will be disabled and the user can click the ok button to continue with authentication. In the event of an error during authentication the user will be prompted. For networks that require authentication for WEP, WPA PSK, or WPA2 Personal security the user name field is diabled because it is unecessary and the user is only required to enter the password needed to authenticate to the network. The Application currently cannot authenticate to networks that are using WPA Enterprise or WPA2 Enterprise authentication. Support for these WLANs will be a feature that will be completed as development continues. IF authenticationis successful the application will scan for the airport service  that is used by Apple Airport Extreme and Apple Time Machine  routers. If the server can be found within the network the table view will display boththe service name and the service type in the main display. The application is designed for use in the 64bit  OS X 10.7 (Lion) environment.  The project is available on github under the repository name MacSniffer.
